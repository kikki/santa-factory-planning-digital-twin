# Santa Factory Simulation - Quick Start

Welcome to the **Santa Factory Simulation**! This guide helps you get started quickly with the simulation.

---

## 📋 Overview

The Santa Factory Simulation is a discrete event simulation (DES) model for analyzing production capacity in early-stage factory planning. You can test various scenarios and evaluate whether Santa's production targets are achievable.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: With Siemens Plant Simulation (Recommended)

**Requirements:**
- Siemens Plant Simulation version V2404 or higher
- Student or full version

**Steps:**
1. Open the file `santa_factory.spp` or `santa_factory.psfm`
2. Configure the parameters (see below)
3. Start the simulation with the Start button
4. Analyze the results

**Advantages:**
- Complete customization options
- Save simulation results
- Detailed evaluation and analysis

### Option 2: Executable Version (.exe)

**Requirements:**
- No installation required

**Steps:**
1. Double-click on `santa_factory.exe`
2. Interact with the predefined parameters
3. Start the simulation

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Cannot save results
- Limited customization options
- Suitable for demonstration and first steps

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Set Production Target Quantity

Choose the target production quantity as a percentage of worldwide children population:

- **10%** = 200,000 units (low)
- **50%** = 1,000,000 units (medium)
- **100%** = 2,000,000 units (high)

### 2. Configure Production Processes

The simulation includes six production processes:

| Process | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Programming_P1** | Digital initialization |
| **Pressing_P2** | Physical base manufacturing |
| **Modelling_Design_P3** | Creative individualization |
| **Testing_P4** | Quality control |
| **AI_Initialisation_P5** | AI initialization |
| **Packing_Sack_P6** | Packaging |

**Configurable Parameters:**
- **Number of machines** per process

### 3. Start Simulation

1. Review your configuration
2. Click **Start**
3. Observe the material flow
4. Wait for the results

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Produced Quantity:** Number of completed products
- **Target Achievement:** Percentage achievement of target production quantity 
- **Throughput Time:** Average time from process start to completion
- **Utilization:** Utilization of individual processes
- **Bottlenecks:** Identification of capacity constraints

### Questions for Analysis

- Was the target production quantity achieved?
- Which processes are bottlenecks?
- How high is facility utilization?
- What measures are needed to achieve the target quantity?
